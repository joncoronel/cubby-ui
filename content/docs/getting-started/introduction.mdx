## What is Cubby UI?

Cubby UI is a collection of opinionated components built on [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS 4. It adds styling and functionality defaults on top of Base UI's unstyled, accessible primitives.

## Why Cubby UI?

- **Opinionated styling** - Pre-styled components built on Base UI's unstyled, accessible primitives. No need to design from scratch.
- **Common patterns built-in** - Abstracts common use cases so you don't have to wire up the same functionality repeatedly.
- **Full ownership** - Components are copied into your project via the [shadcn registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry), not imported from a package. Customize freely.

## Other Options

There are several great UI libraries built on Base UI. Here are some worth checking out:

- [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/create) - Shadcn/UI now offers all their ui components with Base UI as the component library. This is a great option if you are already using Shadcn/UI and want to use Base UI components.
- [Coss UI](https://coss.com/ui/docs) - Great collection of components built by the team of Cal.com that is also built on top of Base UI.
