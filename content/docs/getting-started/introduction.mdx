## What is Cubby UI?

Cubby UI is a collection of opinionated components built on [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS 4. It adds styling and functionality defaults on top of Base UI's unstyled, accessible primitives.

## Why Cubby UI?

### Copy and Paste, Not a Dependency

Components are installed via the [shadcn registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry)—code is copied into your project, not imported from a package. You own every component and can customize freely.

### Inspiration/Recommendations

While there are many options available now in terms of UI libraries, if you are searching for something more stable to use in production apps, there are a couple that I would highly recommend checking out.

- [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/create) - Shadcn/UI now offers all their ui components with Base UI as the component library. This is a great option if you are already using Shadcn/UI and want to use Base UI components.
- [Coss UI](https://coss.com/ui/docs) - Great collection of components built by the team of Cal.com that is also built on top of Base UI.
