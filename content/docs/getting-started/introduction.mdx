## What is Cubby UI?

Cubby UI is a collection of opinionated primitive and composable components built on top of Base UI with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS 4.
Base UI is a library of unstyled, accessible components that is actively being developed and receives regular updates. Cubby UI builds on top of Base UI to provide opinionated defaults in styling and functionality.

While most components are built on top of Base UI, some components are built from scratch to fill in more niche use cases. As Base UI continues to release new components, Cubby UI will continue to build on top of them to provide a comprehensive collection of components.

For more information about Base UI, please visit the [Base UI website](https://base-ui.com).

## Why Cubby UI?

Cubby UI was originally started from the desire to have components I could reuse that fit my preferences for styling and functionality. Eventually, I decided to build a library of components that I could use in my own projects and share with the community. The library is still a work in progress, but I am happy to share what I have so far.

### Copy and Paste, Not a Dependency

Cubby UI components are installable through the [shadcn registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry), which means the code is copied directly into your project rather than imported from a package, other than dependencies like Base UI. This gives you full ownership and control over every component. You can customize, extend, or refactor them to fit your exact needs without being locked into a specific version or waiting for updates.

### Inspiration

I will acknowledge that recently, there have been many great component libraries released that are worth checking out. To name a few that I have been inspired by:

- [Coss UI](https://coss.com/ui/docs) - This is probably the one I'm most confident in recommending. Great collection of components built by the team of Cal.com that is also built on top of Base UI.
- [9ui](https://9ui.dev) - The first component library I found that was built on top of Base UI. Covers all of the Base UI core components with nice but minimal styling.
- [Animate UI](https://animated-ui.com) - Collection of animated ui component that are built on top of primitive components from many different libraries such as Radix UI/Base UI. Recommend it if you are seeking components that are heavily but tastefully animated.
- [Smooth UI](https://smoothui.dev) - Collection of beautiful components that cover a wider range of niche use cases.
